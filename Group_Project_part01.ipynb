Whether you're launching a street food stand, a drink shop, or another local venture, your team will gather and analyze relevant data —such as foot traffic, weather patterns, customer trends, or competitor insights— to shape your business plan. Your final deliverable will be a data-supported report and/or presentation to a management board, demonstrating how your findings guide key decisions in operations, marketing, or product offerings.
