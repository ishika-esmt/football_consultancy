        "- merge data from different sources\n",
        "- describe and analyse datasets\n",

        "- calculate aggregated measures, statistics\n",

        "\n",
        "Your task is to design a local business that leverages data from various APIs to make informed, strategic decisions. Whether you're launching a street food stand, a drink shop, or another local venture, your team will gather and analyze relevant data —such as foot traffic, weather patterns, customer trends, or competitor insights— to shape your business plan. Your final deliverable will be a data-supported report and/or presentation to a management board, demonstrating how your findings guide key decisions in operations, marketing, or product offerings. The ultimate goal: to optimize performance and increase the chances of business success. Will your business thrive in today’s data-driven world?\n",

        "You are part of a fact-checking research team investigating common beliefs, trending opinions, or viral social media claims (e.g. “drinking lemon water boosts metabolism” or “blue light ruins your sleep”). Your goal is to dig into reliable sources, data, and expert opinions to determine whether these beliefs hold up under scrutiny. Use data to challenge or prove real-world claims with clear, persuasive insights. Drawing on research, statistics, and visual evidence, your team will present a well-supported explanation to help your audience separate fact from fiction.\n",

        "You may also choose to divide the group into two sides—one defending the belief and the other challenging it—before presenting your findings in a debate or side-by-side analysis.\n",

        "- Electric cars are always better for the environment\n",
        "- Areas with more green space have better physical and mental health outcomes.\n",
        "- Does public sentiment on social media predict stock market trends?"
